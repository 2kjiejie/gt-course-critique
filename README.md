Georgia Institute of Technology Course Critique

To host a 'course critique' you need to have a database (Mysql, postgress), webserver w/php, and ElasticSearch running the JDBC river (https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc)

The ElasticSearch, and database scripts are currently not in the repo, but will be added in a few days, a long with a detailed write-up.
