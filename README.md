Georgia Institute of Technology Course Critique

To host a 'course critique' you need to have a database (Mysql, postgress), webserver w/php, and ElasticSearch running the JDBC river (https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc)

Please contact Georgia Tech's SGA for more detailed instructions on how to host your own 'Course Critique'
